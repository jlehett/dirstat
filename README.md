# dirstat

This is intended to be a CLI tool to view what files and directories are taking up the most space on your system.

command usage: python dirstat.py [Root-Dir-Path] [OPTIONAL: Smallest-Percent-to-View]

Very early prototype.

To-Do:

* Add man page
* Add ability to view root directory as a size, not 100%
* Clean up code / Documentation
